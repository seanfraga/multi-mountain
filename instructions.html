     <p><b>Multidisciplinarity Mountain</b> is a game.</p>
      <p>You are the humanist leader of a multidisciplinary research team.</p>
      <p><b>Your goal</b>: Be the first to reach the summit of <b>Multidisciplinarity Mountain</b>.</p>
      <p>You will pass through three stages.</p> 
      <p>On your trek through <b>The Foothills</b>, you will conceive your project and assemble a project team.</p>
      <p>As you make <b>The Ascent</b>, you will guide your multidisciplinary team to a common goal.</p>
      <p>In reaching <b>The Summit</b>, you will share your project with the world.</p>
      <p>All players start at the <b>Base Camp</b>, identified by three tents (‚õ∫Ô∏è‚õ∫Ô∏è‚õ∫Ô∏è). Each player chooses a token. The person who most recently received a degree plays first; play proceeds to the left. 
      <p>Draw your first card by scanning the QR code for <b>The Foothills</b>. Follow the instructions on the card. To draw additional cards, refresh the page (or scan the QR code again).</p>
      <p>When you reach the square with the signpost for <b>The Ascent</b>, draw cards for this stage by scanning the QR code for <b>The Ascent</b>.</p>
      <p>When you reach the square with the signpost for <b>The Summit</b>, draw cards for this stage by scanning the QR code for <b>The Summit</b>.</p>
      <p>Always draw cards for the stage your token is in. If you slide backward into a previous stage, draw cards for that stage.</p>
      <p>The first player to reach the top of <b>Multidisciplinarity Mountain</b> will scan the QR code to learn what lies on <b>The Horizon</b>.</p>
